Bash Scripting Project 2

Hello. In this project I will be going through a Bash tutorial that was provided by my Professor. After working through it I will then share with a peer as well as fork his/her work. Oppsosed to the professor's recommendation of nano, I used vim as I am just already familiar with it. All of the scripts that are written here work as intended.

As of Sunday, October 4th at 8:22 pm, I have forked their repo and sent him my link so they can do the same. 

Thanks! 

CODE REVIEW Aaron Quintero 

Everything was clean and very understandable to follow along! Everything was good, so my suggestion would to keep doing everything that you have been doing!
